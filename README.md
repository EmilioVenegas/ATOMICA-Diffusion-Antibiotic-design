# ATOMICA-Diffusion-Antibiotic-design
ATOMICA-Diffusion-RL is a unified pipeline for de novo antibiotic design. It conditions an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model (DiffSBDD) using ATOMICAâ€™s universal interaction interface embeddings. The goal is optimizing leads for properties like ADMET against pathogens, such as multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
